# Dotfiles

## About these dotfiles

This repository represents the configuration (dotfiles) for the following CLI tools:

- zsh (shell)
- antigen (zsh plugin manager)
- vim (text editor)
- Vundle (vim plugin manager)

This projects is to be used on unix-like systems such as Linux or macOS.

## Author's note

These configurations represent my personal preferences. I sync them between the various machines I use. MacOS and Arch Linux tend to be the main operating systems on those machines. If this setup is to your liking, feel free to use it as a starting point for your own config. I've tried to keep everything as generic and environment-agnostic as possible.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- Git (see: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Zsh (see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zsh)

## Setup

Based on the following tutorial: [Simplest Way to Sync Dotfiles and Config Using Git by Victor Augusteo](https://medium.com/@augusteo/simplest-way-to-sync-dotfiles-and-config-using-git-14051af8703a)

Choose one of the setup options:

### A) Automatic setup with script

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone --bare https:github.com/RubenSibon/.dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles`

2. Run the install script:

`zsh ~/.scripts/install.zsh`

### B) Manual setup

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone --bare --recursive https:github.com/RubenSibon/.dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles`

2. Check out the cloned bare branch:

`/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME checkout HEAD --force`

3. Pull the submodules:

`/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME submodule update --init --recursive`

5. Source the zsh config or reload the environment:

`source ~/.zshrc`
